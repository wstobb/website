## Preface

My girlfriend recently showed an interest in using Linux, and asked me for help setting it up. Since I know how finicky Linux can be and how important the usability of her computer is for her, I
decided to set up a custom Fedora Atomic Image for her that contains everything she needs.

This is a guide on how to create your own image for your own computer, but you can find the custom image I made for her [here](https://github.com/wstobb/GFOS).

## Goals

- Debloated
- Easy to make modifications
- Automated deployment and updates
- 'Git centric'

## Prerequesites

- Github account
- Git repository
- Basic knowledge of OCI containers

## To be continued soon!
